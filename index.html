            <h3><b><u>Soil Protection</u></b></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Terracing: Creating terraces on steep slopes slows down water runoff and makes the land more suitable for farming.</li>
                <li>Mulching: Applying organic or synthetic mulch helps protect the soil from erosion, retain moisture, and reduce water evaporation.</li>
                <li>Windbreaks: Planting trees or shrubs to block wind reduces the force of wind erosion and prevents soil from being blown away.</li>
                <li>Vegetative Cover: Planting cover crops or grass strips helps stabilize the soil, reducing the impact of wind and water.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card">
            <h3><b><u>Crop Selection</u></b></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Climate Adaptability: Choose crops that are suited to the local climate, including temperature, rainfall, and humidity.</li>
                <li>Soil Type and Fertility: Select crops based on soil type and fertility, ensuring compatibility with the soil's texture and nutrient content.</li>
                <li>Erosion Control: Opt for crops with strong root systems, such as deep-rooted plants or grasses, to help prevent soil erosion.</li>
                <li>Market Demand and Economic Viability: Consider market demand and profitability, ensuring crops are economically viable and support long-term farm sustainability.</li>
